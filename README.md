> TBlocks is a single/multiplayer tetris-like game

## Running the game

### Online Version

The easiest way to run the game is to use the [online version](http://comrade.knl.cat) which is already
deployed to a server on the internet.

### Locally

If you want to run the game locally, you'll need to:

* Clone the repository
* Install dependencies using `npm i`
* Start the project using `npm start`
* Enjoy

*Notice*: The game will use the back-end which is already deployed to match you
with other players. If you want to run your own back-end, you'll need to clone
the [back-end repository](https://github.com/rogerknl/tblocks-back-end) as well.


## How to Play

* `Left Arrow`: Move the current piece to the left
* `Right Arrow`: Move the current piece to the right
* `Up Arrow`: Rotate the current piece
* `Down Arrow`: Move the current piece down by one unit
* `Space Bar`: Drop current piece to the bottom of the board
* `m`: Mute/unmute music
* `M`: Change music track
